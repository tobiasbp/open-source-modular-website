# Mission
The _**open source modular**_ projects is a collection of synthesizer modules
released as open source with the [GPLv3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
license. Each module is accompanied with documentation, which will enable the user
to study the functionality, and read about it's design and features.

We are hoping to build a synthesizer, which
it's users will be able to understand, and be able to modify and improve.
Obvioulsy, one can also ignore the inner workings of the modules, and just have fun
creating sounds with open source hardware. If you are not that interested
in creating sounds, but want to learn about electronics, this project is also for you.

# Format of the modules
The modules are in eurorack format (including [tiles](http://pulplogic.com/1u_tiles/)), with 3.5mm jack connectors.
The schematics and PCBs are designed in [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/).

A module repository consists of the following:
* Documentation of the module.
* A KiCad project.
* A list if components used ([a BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials)).
* Gerber files (For PCB production).

# State of the project
This project is in it's infancy as of October 2022. Some simple modules have been
built, but need documentation and links from this website to the relevant git repositories.

# Contributing
We accept pull requests, but please discuss your improvements or plan
for new modules in advance. Realize, that documentation is important,
so submitting a schematic on it's own, will not be accepted.

# Support
If you have questions, or want to get in touch with other users, please join
our [Discord server](needs_link). If you have found a problem, or a bug in a
module, please create an issue in the [GitHub repository](needs_link).
