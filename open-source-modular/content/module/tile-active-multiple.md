A an active (powered) multiple with one input, and three outputs. The voltage
on the input, will be replicated on the outputs.

The circuit is consists of one Op Amp for buffering (not drawing current)
the input, and three Op Amps in voltage follower configurations for the output.
A resistor on the outputs, limit how much current can be drawn by whatever
is connected to the multiple.

This module is in the tile form factor.
